# Exoplanetary-identification
This is a AI/ML model which helps in correctly identifying exoplanets from new data in accordance of the previous data given. Basically there are many exoplanets which are same in data taken from every mission. Now if a new mission in case happens, We can easily identify which exoplanet is it. If it isn't in previous data then It might be a new exoplanet.
